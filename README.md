# Spotbot
A Spotify player with a Firebase integration. Perfect for an office where everyone can control the player and enqueue tracks. Great together with [spotbot-client](https://github.com/himynameisjonas/spotbot-client).

## Features/Short facts
* Start/Stop audio (of course!)
* Add tracks to a queue.
* Set a playlist or an album as the current playlist.
* Plays from the queue first and fallbacks to the playlist/album when the queue is empty.
* Stores state/queue in Firebase.
* Use a client ([spotbot-client](https://github.com/himynameisjonas/spotbot-client)) to control the player via the firebase connection.

1. Checkout code `git clone https://github.com/himynameisjonas/spotbot.git`

4. Provide a [Spotify app key](https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/) as `spotify_appkey.key` (binary) in the projectâ€™s root.
5. Have a Spotify Premium account and a (free) Firebase account and config the player with a .env file:
